## About me

I am a second-year Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My current focus is foundational machine learning models, especially computer vision and multimodal representation learning. I am actively seeking research opportunities where I can contribute to open-ended, high-impact work.

I enjoy balancing research with creative hobbies. Outside coding and papers, I am a self-taught pianist and a longtime fan of story-rich anime and manga.
