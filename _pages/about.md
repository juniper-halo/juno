I am a second-year Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with a strong interest in research on foundational machine learning models, particularly in computer vision and multimodal representation learning. I am actively seeking research opportunities and mentorship in these areas. I am a recipient of the Edmund James Scholar Award for academic excellence.

Outside of research, I am a self-taught pianist and enjoy reading light novels and manga, with Your Lie in April as a longtime favorite.
